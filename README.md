# Credential Harvesting via Social Engineering

## Overview

This project demonstrates how attackers can illegitimately capture users' login details through social engineering techniques. The process involves:

- **Creating a Malicious Website:** Attackers build a fake website that closely mimics a legitimate one.
- **Sending Phishing Emails:** Attackers craft and send emails containing a link to the malicious site, tricking victims into clicking the link.
- **Harvesting Credentials:** When victims enter their login details on the fake site, the credentials are captured and reported back to the attacker.

**This repository is for educational and authorized security testing purposes only.**

## Features

- Malicious website template for credential harvesting
- Phishing email example with embedded malicious link
- Activity reporting once credentials are captured

## How It Works

1. **Setup the malicious website** that looks like a legitimate login page.
2. **Send phishing emails** to targeted users, encouraging them to visit the fake site.
3. **Capture credentials** entered by the victims and log/report them to the attacker.

## Example Attack Flow

1. Victim receives a phishing email with a link to a fake login page.
2. Victim clicks the link and is redirected to the malicious website.
3. Victim enters their login details.
4. The harvester captures the credentials and reports them to the attacker.
